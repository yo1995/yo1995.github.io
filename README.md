## Main

Jekyll rendered files.

This repository aims to exhibit some of my previous works and thoughts. Currently it seems to contain more life-related blog posts than tech reviews.

The blog was not fully tuned for the maximum performance, hence could be slow during loading. Will optimize if I have adequate reasons to do it. (e.g. `want more fame`/`want a front-end job`/`become an ecrivan`/`want to rebuild a new version`, etc. :joy:)

### Some references - Keep growing~
